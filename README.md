Hello! This source code is my implementation of the minimax algorithm to create a tic-tac-toe AI. Although primitive, the minimax algorithm is very efficient in a game with a small search space like tic-tac-toe. I do not plan on adding much more functionality past this, but I do hope you enjoy and can learn something from reading / tinkering with this code.

Dependencies:
1. Python Tkinter

How to Run:
1. From the command line, run the tictactoe.py file
